## Screen Tastes: The User-Critic Divide in Cinema

*An attempt to explain movie taste differences between users and critics.*

**A project served by the Team #rADAtouille**

---

### Introduction

As it’s often said, “there is no accounting for taste.” But as flavor explorers and taste crafters, we do care about it. And as much as you're a fan of Brussels Sprouts, everybody is not. Same goes for **movies**, and a finer palate might find delicacy in other dishes than your favorite pasta al pesto.

> **Do critics and users have different tastes, and if yes, can we explain it?**

Or is this discrepancy based on something more concrete? That’s the question we want to address, using all the craftsmanship our kitchen brigade freshly learned.
